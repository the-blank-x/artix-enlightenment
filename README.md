# iso-profiles

The Artix ISO profiles.


The profiles are designated base, minimal and community.

Base only offers a bare minimum system, installable from the CLI. For advanced users.

Minimal profiles come with a basic DE (LXDE, LXQt, MATE), slightly preconfigured. The graphics installer of choice is Calamares. For knowledgeable users.

The community profiles come in two flavours, GTK (with MATE and LXDE), and QT (with Plasma and LXQt). They are fully preconfigured and contain many applications for everyday use. Ideal for average or novice users or people that just want a well-endowed live ISO for setting up an out-of-the-box working OS.
